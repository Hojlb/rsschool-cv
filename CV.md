## About myself. 
I have a family. We are in family is four: my wife, daughter, son and I.
Since 2013 year I work in Brestproekt on the position is team-leader group of designers in building and never changed my jom.
I want to change my job because I like a programing. I like to learn new technology, and enjoy to find solution for hard tasks. I also like that in programming you may see results your job at once.
